  Generate a legacy MFLEX pool address and write it into Miningcore's config.json.

  What it does:
  - Ensures a wallet named "pool" exists and is loaded in the MFLEX node
  - Generates a new legacy address
  - Writes it into /home/umbrel/.miningcore/config.json (pool id: mflex)

  Then restart Miningcore to apply the change.
